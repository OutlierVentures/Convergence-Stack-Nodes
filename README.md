# Convergence Stack Nodes

Node launchers for the Convergence Stack. Pull requests welcome.

To start a node, just run the relevant script.

## Requirements

Linux/MacOS and Docker.

In some cases you may get an 'incorrect username or password' error, in which case you just need to login your Docker client: `docker login --username [USERNAME]`.
