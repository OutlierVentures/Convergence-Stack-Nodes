# Convergence Stack Nodes

Node launchers for the Convergence Stack. Pull requests welcome.

To start a node, just run the relevant script.

## Requirements

Linux/MacOS and Docker. The Fetch.AI ledger node does not even require Docker.

In some cases you may get an 'incorrect username or password' error, in which case you just need to login your Docker client: `docker login --username [USERNAME]`.
